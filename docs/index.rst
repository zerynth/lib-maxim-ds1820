Maxim DS1820
************

The DS18S20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper and lower trigger points. The DS18S20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one data line (and ground) for communication with a central microprocessor. In addition, the DS18S20 can derive power directly from the data line (“parasite power”), eliminating the need for an external power supply.

Each DS18S20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18S20s to function on the same 1-Wire bus. Thus, it is simple to use one microprocessor to control many DS18S20s distributed over a large area. Applications that can benefit from this feature include HVAC environmental controls, temperature monitoring systems inside buildings, equipment, or machinery; more information at `Maxim dedicated page <https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18S20.html>`_
